BMEngine is a custom engine written for educational purposes
The main goal is to learn the Vulkan API
Coding standards:
	Simplicity
	Component independence
	Non-pessimization
	Minimal use of libraries (non-custom libraries will be replaced after the renderer component is written)
	
Only Windows platform and VS Studio are supported
GLSL is used as a shading language

The engine supports simple mesh drawing, Phong shading source, and basic 2D shadow for directional light

My priority priority tasks in the engine is to simplify the interface to the Vulkan, design the rendering system, and move data from the code to configs
